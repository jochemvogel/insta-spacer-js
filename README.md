## Insta spacer

It's not possible to add spaces between lines of your caption in the Instagram UI itself, although this is sometimes useful for readability purposes. Created this small web-app that will replace spaces with invisible separators.

### Future

Not going to update this repo anymore. I was trying to figure out how to add a bold/italic feature, but found some better solutions (like https://lingojam.com/BoldLetters). I'm not going to reinvent the wheel while there are plenty of options out there ðŸ˜‰

Link is still useful for adding spaces in your Instagram captions, but most modern note apps (Apple Notes does) will also do that for you these days.
